    <h1>HELLO!  Big news ahead.</h1>
    <h3>Crashing news about our blogger “Zaha Hadid”

        Her words—especially the famous quote,
         “There are 360 degrees. Why stick to one?”—
        have stuck with architects in China and designers
         in Germany and India. Her principles have fostered 
        new possibilities in architectural research, thinking, 
        and process. In every way, Hadid remains a muse.
         Why do people like Zaha Hdid’s work?
        Hadid led over sixty major projects during her career.
        She used cultural context to enrich her work. As well as 
        embracing her own Arab identity and using it to distinguish
        her as an architect, her buildings both respond to the cultural
        context of their place in the world, and gently challenge
        that culture.
